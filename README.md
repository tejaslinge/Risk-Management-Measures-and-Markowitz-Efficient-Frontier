# Risk-Management-Measures-and-Markowitz-Efficient-Frontier
Markowitz Efficient Frontier and other risk management measures

In this Jupyter Notebook, I've demonstrated how to calculate some of the basic risk measures and plot the Efficient Frontier for a portfolio in Python. 
This notebook includes calculation and plots of measures such as:
1. Standard Deviation (Volatility)
2. Expected Returns
3. Drawdown
4. VaR and CVar
5. Sharpe Ratio
6. Efficient Frontier
7. Capital Market Line (CML)
8. Global Minimum Variance (GMV) Portfolio
9. Beta
